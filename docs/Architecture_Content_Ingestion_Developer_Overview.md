# Architecture Content Ingestion Developer Overview

Developer Overview & Introduction

# 🎯 What You're Building

You're building an automated pipeline that syncs enterprise architecture documentation from SharePoint and Microsoft Teams into a GitHub repository as Markdown files. Think of it as a "content bridge" that keeps GitHub in sync with the source systems.

**The Flow:**

SharePoint/Teams → Your Pipeline → GitHub → Downstream Systems\
(Monitor, Convert, Publish)

# 📋 The Problem We're Solving

**Current State:**

- Architecture docs live in SharePoint sites and Teams channels

- Downstream systems (Architecture Portal, AI chatbot, Cortex search) need this content

- Manual copy/paste is slow, error-prone, and doesn't scale

**Your Solution:**

- Automatically monitor SharePoint/Teams for changes

- Convert documents to Markdown format

- Publish to GitHub repository

- Downstream systems pick up changes automatically

# 🏗️ High-Level Architecture

**SOURCE SYSTEMS (Read-only - Don't modify these)**

- SharePoint Sites: IT Architecture, Enterprise Docs, Q4 Planning

- Microsoft Teams: Engineering Team, Design Channel, Architecture Channel

**YOUR PIPELINE COMPONENTS (This is what you're building)**

**1️⃣ FILE MONITOR**

- Poll SharePoint/Teams APIs

- Discover new/modified files

- Microsoft Graph API integration

**2️⃣ CHANGE DETECTOR**

- Calculate MD5 checksums

- Compare with previous state

- Skip unchanged files (efficiency)

**3️⃣ JOB CONVERTER**

- Extract content from source files

- Convert DOCX/PDF/PPTX → Markdown

- Preserve metadata (source, date, etc.)

**4️⃣ GITHUB PUBLISHER**

- Create/update files in GitHub repo

- Organize in clean folder structure

- Commit with traceable history

**5️⃣ STATE TRACKER**

- SQLite database of processed files

- Stores checksums, timestamps

- Prevents duplicate processing

**6️⃣ LOGGER**

- Track all operations

- Error handling and reporting

- Performance metrics

**DOWNSTREAM SYSTEMS (Already exist - You just validate they still work)**

- Architecture Portal

- AI Chatbot

- Cortex Search

# 🎬 How It Works (Simple Example)

*Scenario: Someone updates a Word document in SharePoint*

**Monitor (every 15 minutes)**

- Your pipeline polls SharePoint API

- Finds: "design-patterns.docx" was modified

**Detect Change**

- Calculate MD5: abc123...

- Compare with database: old hash: xyz789...

- Result: File changed! ✅

**Convert**

- Download: design-patterns.docx

- Extract content using mammoth.js

- Output: design-patterns.md (Markdown)

**Publish**

- GitHub path: sharepoint/it-architecture/design-patterns.md

- Commit message: \[Ingestion\] Update: design-patterns.md

- Push to GitHub

**Update State**

- Save new MD5: abc123...

- Timestamp: 2026-02-13T10:30:00Z

**Trigger Downstream**

- GitHub Actions runs automatically

- Portal rebuilds with new content

- AI chatbot reindexes

- Done! 🎉

# 🔑 Key Concepts You Need to Know

**1. Microsoft Graph API**

- Single API to access SharePoint, Teams, OneDrive, etc.

- Uses OAuth 2.0 for authentication

- You'll need: Tenant ID, Client ID, Client Secret

**2. MD5 Checksums (Change Detection)**

- Hash of file content

- Same content = same hash

- Different content = different hash

- Prevents reprocessing unchanged files

**3. Markdown Conversion**

- Goal: Convert Word/PDF/PowerPoint to plain text with formatting

- Preserves: Headers, lists, links, basic formatting

- Loses: Complex layouts, proprietary features

**4. GitHub API (Octokit)**

- Create/update files in repositories

- Files are base64 encoded

- Each operation creates a commit

**5. Idempotency (Run it multiple times safely)**

- Same input = same output

- No duplicates or corruption

- Critical for reliability

# ⚡ Quick Start (Your First Task)

**Week 1 - Get Up and Running**

**1. Clone the starter repo (or create new):**

mkdir architecture-ingestion\
cd architecture-ingestion\
npm init -y

**2. Install dependencies:**

npm install @microsoft/microsoft-graph-client @octokit/rest\
npm install mammoth better-sqlite3 dotenv winston

**3. Create .env file (get these from Lilly team):**

\# Microsoft Graph API\
MICROSOFT_TENANT_ID=xxx\
MICROSOFT_CLIENT_ID=xxx\
MICROSOFT_CLIENT_SECRET=xxx\
\
\# GitHub\
GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_xxx\
GITHUB_OWNER=eli-lilly\
GITHUB_REPO=architecture-docs\
\
\# SharePoint Sites (comma-separated)\
SHAREPOINT_SITES=site-id-1,site-id-2

**4. Test Microsoft Graph connection:**

// test-graph.js\
const client = require('@microsoft/microsoft-graph-client');\
require('isomorphic-fetch');\
\
// Get token using client credentials flow\
const getAccessToken = async () =\> {\
// You'll implement this with MSAL library\
};\
\
const graphClient = Client.init({\
authProvider: async (done) =\> {\
const token = await getAccessToken();\
done(null, token);\
}\
});\
\
// List SharePoint sites\
const sites = await graphClient.api('/sites').get();\
console.log('Sites:', sites.value);

# 🎯 Success Criteria (How You Know It Works)

**Week 2 Check:**

- Can connect to SharePoint API

- Can list files from configured sites

- Can download a test file

- Can convert DOCX to Markdown

**Week 4 Check:**

- Can detect when a file changes

- Only processes changed files (skips unchanged)

- Can publish Markdown to GitHub

- GitHub folder structure is clean

**Week 7 (Final):**

- End-to-End Test: Update a Word doc in SharePoint → See it in GitHub within 15 minutes

- No Manual Steps: Fully automated, no human intervention

- Reliable: Handles errors gracefully, logs everything

- Downstream Works: Architecture Portal updates automatically

# 🚨 Things to Watch Out For

**Common Pitfalls:**

**API Rate Limits**

- Microsoft Graph: ~2,000 requests/hour

- GitHub: ~5,000 requests/hour

- Solution: Batch operations, cache responses

**Large Files**

- Some PDFs/DOCX are 50+ MB

- Solution: Stream processing, timeout handling

**Authentication Expiry**

- Tokens expire (typically 1 hour)

- Solution: Refresh tokens automatically

**Conversion Failures**

- Corrupted files, unsupported formats

- Solution: Try-catch, log and skip, don't crash

**Duplicate Processing**

- Running pipeline twice shouldn't duplicate content

- Solution: Check state database before processing

# 🤔 Key Questions to Ask Lilly Team (Week 1)

**Access:**

- What are the SharePoint site IDs we should monitor?

- Can you create a service account with read-only access?

**Scope:**

- How many files are we talking about? (100s, 1000s, 10,000s?)

- What file types are most common? (DOCX, PDF, both?)

- Are there folders we should exclude?

**GitHub:**

- What's the exact repository name?

- Any branch protection rules?

- Who should be the commit author?

**CATS:**

- Do you have CATS API documentation?

- Who's our technical contact for CATS?

**Performance:**

- How often should this run? (every 15 min, hourly, daily?)

- What's the expected change rate? (10 files/day, 100 files/day?)
